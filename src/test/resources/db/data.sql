The national assault-weapons ban, which was in place for 10 years, lapsed in 2004.');

But the price of proving his authority with a radical GOP conference was pushing the nation closer to a debt default cliff edge in an increasingly alarming showdown with President Joe Biden. The bill, which raises the debt ceiling for a year in return for spending cuts, was designed to hike pressure on Biden, who is refusing to accept Republican conditions that would effectively gut his domestic agenda. Unless the debt ceiling is lifted by the summer, the economy could crash.');
